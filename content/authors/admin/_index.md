# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I'm a graduate student at GRASP lab, University of Pennsylvania. I'm currently working on DCIST (a project focusing on multi-agent and heterogeneous systems) in Kumar Lab, which's a subgroup of GRASP. I have a broad interest in different tracks of robotics such as: SWARM Intelligence, Human Robot Teaming, Optimal Control, Computer Vision, etc. Much of my work focuses on ensuring safe and agile performance of algorithms on real robotics platforms, as you can see from the following projects.

For now, I feel fortunate enough to be supervised by Prof. Vijay Kumar and Dr. Siddharth Mayya to work on multi-agent algorithms and their possible applications on quadrotor platforms.
